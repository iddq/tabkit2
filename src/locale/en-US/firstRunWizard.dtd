The best way to get started with Tab Kit is probably to read through the Options menu (Tools -&gt; Add-ons -&gt; Tab Kit -&gt; Options), which lists all the features available. Tab Kit also adds a submenu to the tab right-click menu with some useful commands. More comprehensive documentation is in the works (help appreciated!)">
